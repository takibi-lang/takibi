This file holds QEMU/AArch64 bare-metal reference material for the
`examples/common_qemu/` HAL and the virtio-net stepping-stone examples --
Claude Code loads it automatically whenever a file under this directory is
read. It was split out of the project root's `CLAUDE.md` to keep that file
under Claude Code's context budget; read root `CLAUDE.md` first for the
project's overall goals, build commands, and process rules that apply
everywhere.


## QEMU Bare-Metal (AArch64)

- Machine: `virt`, CPU: `cortex-a53`
- PL011 UART register: `0x09000000` (QEMU pre-initializes it, so no baud rate setup needed)
- PL031 RTC register: `0x09010000` (RTCDR: +0, RTCCR: +0x0C) -- 1-second resolution time counter
  - RTCCR always returns 1 in QEMU (RTC is always running)
  - ARM Generic Timer (`mrs` instruction) cannot be called directly from takibi (it is a system register)
- Load address: `0x40000000` (start of QEMU virt RAM)
- Semihosting exit: `SYS_EXIT` (x0=0x18) + AArch64 extended format
  - x1 is not a value but a pointer to a 2-word block: `[ADP_Stopped_ApplicationExit, 0]`
  - QEMU launch option: `-semihosting-config enable=on,target=native`
- Assembler: `llvm-mc-19`, linker: `ld.lld-19`
- QEMU integration tests feed stdin synchronously via a named pipe (FIFO) (`scripts/run_qemutest.sh`)
- `startup.S` enables IRQ/FIQ for all examples (`msr DAIFClr, #0x3`). All interrupts are disabled when the GIC is not initialized, so existing examples are unaffected.
- Exception vector table (2KB aligned): All IRQ/FIQ entries for EL1t/EL1h are wired to `irq_entry`. `irq_entry` saves all registers then calls `irq_dispatch`. If a takibi program does not define `irq_dispatch`, a `.weak` no-op is used.
- GICv2 (`0x08000000`): built into QEMU virt. Without security extensions (`secure=on` not used), GICD_CTLR bit0=EnableGrp0. All SPIs stay Group0 unless GICD_IGROUPR is written. With GICC_CTLR.FIQEn=0 (default), Group0 interrupts arrive as IRQ (0x280: EL1h IRQ vector). Setting FIQEn=1 is required for them to arrive as FIQ (0x300).
- ARM Generic Timer (EL1 physical timer):
  - `cntp_tval_el0`: countdown timer value register (count until fire)
  - `cntp_ctl_el0`: bit0=ENABLE (1 to enable)
  - `cntfrq_el0`: timer clock frequency (62500000 = 62.5 MHz on QEMU virt)
  - Connected to the GIC via PPI #30 (GICD_ISENABLER0 bit30)
  - To fire at ~15 ms intervals: `lsr x0, cntfrq, #6` -> `msr cntp_tval_el0, x0`
  - The virtual timer (CNTV, PPI #27) requires EL2 hypervisor configuration on QEMU virt, so use the physical timer (CNTP, PPI #30) for bare-metal EL1.

## virtio-net Examples (examples/net_echo, examples/arp_reply, examples/icmp_echo)

QEMU-only stepping stones toward the TCP/IP stack goal, each adding one
protocol layer on top of the same virtqueue/DMA/IRQ plumbing:
- `net_echo`: receives a raw Ethernet frame over virtio-net, swaps
  src/dst MAC, sends it back unchanged otherwise. No protocol parsing at
  all -- proves the plumbing works.
- `arp_reply`: answers ARP "who-has 192.0.2.1" with "is-at <our MAC>"
  (192.0.2.1 is RFC 5737 TEST-NET-1, chosen specifically because it's
  reserved for exactly this kind of test/example use); every other frame
  (wrong EtherType, wrong OPER, request for a different IP) is dropped,
  not echoed. First real protocol dispatch and in-place header rewriting.
- `icmp_echo`: answers ICMP echo requests (ping) addressed to 192.0.2.1
  with an echo reply, preserving identifier/sequence/payload. First
  example needing a *correct* checksum on the wire (not just a validated
  one) -- see HISTORY.md's "IPv4/ICMP: split into 3 deliberately small steps" entry for the two smaller
  steps this was deliberately split from.

`virtio-net` doesn't exist on real hardware. STM32 now has a dedicated
MAC/PHY/DMA backend with the same public network API; any future RPi3 or
RISC-V hardware port would need its own equivalent backend. What transfers
is the ring-buffer/IRQ pattern and the raw-byte-offset header manipulation
technique, not the virtio protocol itself.

- **Legacy virtio-mmio only** (`-global virtio-mmio.force-legacy=on`).
  Skips the FEATURES_OK handshake and the split 64-bit feature/queue-address
  registers of modern (v2) virtio-mmio -- Version register reads 1. This
  depends on a QEMU compatibility knob that could be removed in a future
  release; if legacy mode disappears, this driver needs a rewrite against
  the modern register layout.
- **The virtio-mmio slot is discovered at boot, not hardcoded**
  (`virtio_net_find()` in `examples/common_qemu/virtio_mmio.tkb`). A lone
  `-device virtio-net-device` does NOT land on slot 0: empirically, under
  this devcontainer's QEMU 8.2.2, it landed on slot 31 (base `0x0a003e00`).
  The driver scans all 32 slots for `DeviceID == 1` (network), derives both
  its base address and GIC SPI, routes that SPI to CPU0, and acknowledges
  legacy queue interrupts inside the driver-owned IRQ dispatcher.
- **The vring uses typed views over one shared backing allocation.**
  `VirtqDesc`, `VirtqAvail`, `VirtqUsed`, and `VirtqUsedElem` describe the
  specification-defined layouts. Descriptor writes use `descs[i].field`,
  while `sizeof(VirtqDesc)` and `offsetof(..., ring)` locate the avail/used
  subregions without duplicating byte offsets. The used-ring views are `*io`
  so device-written fields remain volatile. The page-aligned byte arrays are
  still the owning storage because all three regions must share one legacy
  virtqueue allocation.
  `arp_reply.tkb` extends the same technique to the ARP header itself
  (`bytes_eq`/`bytes_copy`/`read_u16be`/`write_u16be`), rewriting the
  request into a reply in place with no temporary struct/copy -- this was
  a deliberate choice over copying into a local struct and back (see
  git history around 2026-07 for the reasoning): raw offsets touch only
  the bytes that actually change and avoid a full extra copy in and out,
  and takibi has no struct-literal-from-bytes/memcpy builtin that would
  make the copy-based version meaningfully shorter anyway.
- **MAC/IP fields are always handled as raw byte arrays, never as a single
  multi-byte integer.** They're compared/copied byte-by-byte
  (`bytes_eq`/`bytes_copy`), not loaded as e.g. a `u32`, specifically to
  avoid an endianness bug: ARP fields are big-endian on the wire, this
  target is little-endian, and a raw multi-byte load would silently
  byte-reverse the value. `read_u16be`/`write_u16be` (used for EtherType
  and ARP OPER, which *are* conventionally written/compared as 16-bit hex
  constants like `0x0806`) manually compose/decompose big-endian integers
  from individual byte reads/writes instead of relying on the host's
  native load width, sidestepping the issue entirely regardless of target
  endianness.
- **`arp_reply.tkb` reads its own MAC from the device instead of
  hardcoding it**, via `virtio_net_read_mac()` in `virtio_mmio.tkb`
  (Config space offset `0x100`, gated on negotiating `VIRTIO_NET_F_MAC`).
  This is why `virtio_negotiate()` takes a `features: i32` parameter
  instead of always acking 0 -- `net_echo.tkb` still passes `0` (it never
  reads Config space), `arp_reply.tkb` passes `VIRTIO_NET_F_MAC`. Avoids a
  second hardcoded MAC constant that would need to be kept in sync with
  the QEMU command line's `mac=` value.
- **Used-ring reads must be `io`.** `used_idx_get` etc. read memory the device
  writes via DMA. An interrupt is only a notification, so normal context
  re-checks the used ring after `interrupt_wait()` wakes. Volatile access
  prevents LLVM from caching or hoisting these externally modified loads.
- **Test harness**: `scripts/virtio_net_test.py`, `scripts/arp_test.py`,
  and `scripts/icmp_echo_test.py` send/verify raw frames over a UDP-backed
  `-netdev dgram` (one UDP datagram == one raw Ethernet frame, no
  ARP/DHCP noise since it's a private point-to-point socket, unlike
  `-netdev user`). This is the one place in the test suite that depends
  on Python -- `run_qemutest.sh` invokes them via
  `run_virtio_test NAME KERNEL SCRIPT`, which judges pass/fail by the
  script's exit code rather than diffing QEMU's stdout, so the kernels
  are free to print debug output. Deliberately NOT unit-tested in
  isolation (no QEMU-free test of the comparison logic): the scripts are
  simple enough (plain byte-equality checks) that the cost of a second,
  QEMU-booting "does the test detect a broken echo" test wasn't judged
  worth it -- see git history around 2026-07 if that tradeoff needs
  revisiting as the scripts grow more complex.
